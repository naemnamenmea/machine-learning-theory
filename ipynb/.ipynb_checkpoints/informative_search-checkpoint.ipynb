    "\n",
    "Problem Statement: To simply put, You have 1 million text files in a directory and your application must cater text query search on all files within few seconds (say ~1-2 seconds). How will you develop such system !!.\n",

    "Motivation: The idea came from my previous post “Performing OCR by running parallel instances of Tesseract 4.0 : Python“. Saying that following could be some use cases where you may have to build such search engine on top of other applications. e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "    You have built an OCR app and converted millions of images into text files. You may want to build a search engine over converted text files to search contents of images.\n",
    "    You have built a speech to text system where you are converting thousands of recorded audios into text data. You may like to search contents of audio in real time."
